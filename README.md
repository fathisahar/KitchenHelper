This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Screenshots of the application

This was my original idea for the interface to add recipes but I ended up deciding against it (too cluttered). However, I definitely spent too much time on it so I still wanted to include a screenshot of it.

To edit an image, the user can click on the image, which toggles the URL field. To remove the URL field (unedited, other the user can click the confirm button which appears upon any change to the ingredient), the user can reclick the image.
