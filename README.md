This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Screenshots of the application

This was my original idea for the interface to add recipes but I ended up deciding against it (too cluttered). However, I definitely spent too much time on it so I still wanted to include a screenshot of it.
