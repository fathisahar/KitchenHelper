# KitchenHelper 

A React web-application which keeps track of ingredients available to the user and recipes which the user knows of. The application provides recipes which are possible to make considering the available ingredients. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Screenshots of the application

### Ingredients

How ingredients are currently displayed:

To add an ingredient:

To edit an image, the user can click on the image, which toggles the URL field. To remove the URL field (unedited, otherwise the user can click the confirm button which appears upon any change to the ingredient), the user can reclick the image.

### Categories

For categories of ingredients or recipes, the same design applies.

The same functionality applies with the recipe displayal and creation:

### Previous designs
This was my original idea for the interface to add recipes but I ended up deciding against it (too cluttered). However, I definitely spent too much time on it so I still wanted to include a screenshot of it.
