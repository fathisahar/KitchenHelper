input validation to do:
- cant have repeat inputs (verify names)
- make all names lower caps when submitting

bugs right now:
- can only modify ingredient successfully if all fields are being modified (have to put input in the fields)
- maybe move towards object oriented design? rather than straight SQL to front end, have explicit object definition in backend 


to run server.py: python3 server.py
to run react webapp: run npm start




mysql -u root -p
mysql -u saharfathi -p
source ~/.bashrc
SHOW DATABASES;
DROP DATABASE food;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'your_new_username'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;

 for login:
 - have restrictions on usernames, passwords (validation) 
 - send email to confirm account creation
